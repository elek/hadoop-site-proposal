HTTP transactions
-   Lower default minimum heartbeat for task trackers from 3 sec to
300msec to increase job throughput on small clusters
-   Port of Gridmix v3
-   Set MALLOC\_ARENA\_MAX in hadoop-config.sh to resolve problems with
glibc in RHEL-6
-   Splittable bzip2 files
-   Of course it also has the same security fix as release 1.0.4.
