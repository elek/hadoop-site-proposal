title: Release 3.0.0-alpha1 available
date: "2016-09-03"
---
This is the first alpha in a series of planned alphas and betas leading
up to a 3.0.0 GA release. The intention is to "release early, release
often" to quickly iterate on feedback collected from downstream users.

Please note that alpha releases come with no guarantees of quality or
API stability, and are not intended for production use.

Users are encouraged to read the [overview of major
changes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.0-alpha1/index.html) coming
