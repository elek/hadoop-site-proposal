title: release 0.23.1 available
date: 2012-02-27
---

This is the second alpha version of the hadoop-0.23 major release after
the first alpha 0.23.0. This release has significant improvements
compared to 0.23.0 but should still be considered as alpha-quality and
not for production use.

hadoop-0.23.1 contains several major advances from 0.23.0:

-   Lots of bug fixes and improvements in both HDFS and MapReduce
-   Major performance work to make this release either match or exceed
performance of Hadoop-1 in most aspects of both HDFS and MapReduce.
-   Several downstream projects like HBase, Pig, Oozie, Hive etc. are
better integrated with this release

See the [Hadoop 0.23.1 Release
Notes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.23.1/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/releasenotes.html)
for details.
