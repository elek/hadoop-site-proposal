Other Hadoop-related projects at Apache include:

-   [**Ambari™**](http://apache.ambari.org): A web-based tool for provisioning,
    managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters which includes
    support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, HCatalog, HBase,
    ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides a dashboard
    for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to view
    MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually alongwith features to
    diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly
    manner.
-   [**Avro™**](http://avro.apache.org): A data serialization system.
-   [**Cassandra™**](ext:cassandra): A scalable multi-master database
    with no single points of failure.
-   [**Chukwa™**](ext:chukwa): A data collection system for managing
    large distributed systems.
-   [**HBase™**](ext:hbase): A scalable, distributed database that
    supports structured data storage for large tables.
-   [**Hive™**](ext:hive): A data warehouse infrastructure that provides
    data summarization and ad hoc querying.
-   [**Mahout™**](ext:mahout): A Scalable machine learning and data
    mining library.
-   [**Pig™**](ext:pig): A high-level data-flow language and execution
    framework for parallel computation.
-   [**Spark™**](ext:spark): A fast and general compute engine for
    Hadoop data. Spark provides a simple and expressive programming
    model that supports a wide range of applications, including ETL,
    machine learning, stream processing, and graph computation.
-   [**Tez™**](ext:tez): A generalized data-flow programming framework,
    built on Hadoop YARN, which provides a powerful and flexible engine
    to execute an arbitrary DAG of tasks to process data for both batch
    and interactive use-cases. Tez is being adopted by Hive™, Pig™ and
    other frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem, and also by other
    commercial software (e.g. ETL tools), to replace Hadoop™ MapReduce
    as the underlying execution engine.
-   [**ZooKeeper™**](ext:zookeeper): A high-performance coordination
    service for distributed applications.
