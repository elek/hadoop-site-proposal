# Apache Hadoop site

## Usage

The site is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

To generate a site you need only one binary. Follow the install guide of the hugo site.

After the installation you can generate the site with:

`hugo`

And the site will be generated to the `public` sub directory.

To improve/develop the site, you can use

```
hugo server --refresh
```

which starts a standalone auto-refreshed web server.

## Content

To create a new relase, create a file in  ```content/release``` directory. The file name should be ```<version>.md```where version is the release version.

Example: content/release/2.7.3.md
